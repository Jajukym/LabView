About this book

A manual for a programming language called "LabVIEW". It's all free.
Although LabVIEW is an expensive tool for professionals who develop automatic 
measurement and control systems, "LabVIEW Community Edition" that can be used 
for free only for hobby was released in April 2020.
This is a great tool that allows you to create advanced software as if you were
drawing it, so we wanted as many people as possible to know how wonderful 
LabVIEW is.

It is written for people over junior high school who are interested in 
programming and electronic work. Even if you are new to programming or LabVIEW,
it's okay.
A Windows computer is required to experiment with what is written. The contents
may be a little difficult, but for the time being, please read while executing 
the sample VI. If you don't understand it, you can search it online or ask 
someone who knows it later.

The included VIs (LabVIEW programs) can be loaded in LabVIEW 2014 or later 
versions of LabVIEW, so you can use them at school or at work.
Some VIs use LINX and VISA libraries, so make sure you have VI Package Manager 
and NI-VISA installed. The VI Package Manager makes it easy to download 
Digilent LINX (community editions install them automatically).

We are pleased to announce the world's first (probably) community edition 
manual. Unfortunately, We didn't have the time to translate all the content. 
We are looking for volunteers to help with the translation. Please contact us 
by searching for "Emboar_Dymax" on the NI Community Page.
