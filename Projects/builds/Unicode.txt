To display Unicode languages, modify the LabVIEW .ini configuration file, using the following steps:
Navigate to
C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\<LabVIEW>\LabVIEW.ini
Add UseUnicode=TRUE to any new line in the LabVIEW .ini file.
Save the file and exit LabVIEW. Upon relaunching LabVIEW, the Unicode characters should work correctly, whether typing or pasting in. 

For control/indicator labels, it may be necessary to enter text as a Caption, not a Label. Right-click on the control/indicator and select Visible ItemsÂ»Caption from the right-click menu. 

Note: When building an executable that requires Unicode characters, insert the UseUnicode=TRUE line into the application .ini file generated with the executable.
