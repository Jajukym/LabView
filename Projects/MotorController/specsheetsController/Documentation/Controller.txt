Motor_Controller

Setup:
	Copy "specsheetsController" folder in the "C:\" root directory
	From the "Volume_x.x.x.x" folder, run install.exe

Connect USB cables to the PC:
	Oscilloscope:
		a. Turn on all channels on the oscilloscope
		b. Set horizontal (voltage) indicator for each channel to x-axis -3
		c. set vertical (time) indicator to y-axis -4
	Signal generator
	USB Scanner
	RS232 to UART adapter

----------------LAUNCH APPLICATION----------------

Initialize
01. Fill out form with user information, vendor information, and order information.
02. Select instrument connection ports (USB serial, oscilloscope, and waveform generator).
03. On the harness box, verity that the switches are set as: "SWR", "SWR", "P/L", and "PRI".
04. Connect scope leads to Secondary ports 1, 2, 3, and 4 matching probe numbers.
05. On the harness box, verify that the probe lead positions match the positions in the photo.
06. Scan test sample barcode.

Software
01. Connect harness to sample under test at points:
	a. Motor + Connector
	b. Motor - Connector
	c. Neutral Connector
	d. Line Connector
	e. Incline Header
	f. Programming Header
	g. 15V Test Point
	h. HV bus Test Point
	i. Console Header(if 12-pin header, connect 4-pin UART_Read to last 4 pins of the header)
	j. Incline Sense Header
	k. Tach Sense Header(if controller part number is 359336, DO NOT CONNECT!)

04. On the harness box, verity that the switches are set as: "SWR", "SWR", "P/L", and "PRI".

06. On the harness box, verify that the probe lead positions match the positions in the photo.
07. Turn on the controller power switch.
08. Scan test sample barcode.

Secondary
01. On the harness box, verify that the switches are set as: "MEA", "PWM", "P/L", and "PRI".
02. On the harness box, verify that the probe lead positions match the positions in the photo.
03. Click begin to test console side voltage.

Incline/Primary
01. On the harness box, verify that the switches are set as: "MEA", "PWM", "INC", and "PRI".
02. Connect scope leads to Incline ports 3 and 4 matching probe numbers.
03. Connect scope leads to Primary ports 1 and 2 matching probe numbers.
04. On the harness box, verify that the probe lead positions match the positions in the photo.
05. Click begin to test incline relays.

Motor
01. On the harness box, verify that the switches are set as: "SWR", "PWM", "P/L", and "MOT".
02. Connect scope leads to Motor ports 3 and 4 matching probe numbers.
03. On the harness box, verify that the probe lead positions match the positions in the photo.
04. Set speed potentiometer to the middle position.
05. Click begin to test motor voltages.
06. When prompted, set speed potentiometer to the full counter clockwise (Left) position and click OK.
07. When prompted, set speed potentiometer to the full  clockwise (Right) position and click OK.
08. When prompted, set speed potentiometer to the middle position and click OK.
